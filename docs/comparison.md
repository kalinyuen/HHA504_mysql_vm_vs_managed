# Comparison
## Small Project
A managed database is the better fit for a small student project. It provides easy setup, automatic backups, low cost, and enough performance for basic workloads. This lets students concentrate on building the application instead of dealing with server administration.

## Departmental Analytics Database
For departmental analytics, a self-managed MySQL VM is typically the stronger option. It gives full control over permissions, query optimization, and resource tuning—important for heavier analytical tasks. However, if the team prefers less maintenance or wants built-in monitoring and autoscaling, a managed database can still be a competitive and convenient alternative.

## HIPAA-related Workload
For workloads involving HIPAA considerations or PHI, a managed database is the safest choice. It includes built-in compliance features such as encryption, audit logging, automated backups, and high availability. This reduces operational risk and ensures sensitive health data is protected without requiring the team to manage these controls on their own.
